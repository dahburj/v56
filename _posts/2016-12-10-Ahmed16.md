title: 'Multi-task Learning with Weak Class Labels: Leveraging iEEG to Detect Cortical
  Lesions in Cryptogenic Epilepsy'
abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) is useful for domains in which data originates
  from multiple sources that are individually under-sampled. MTL methods are able
  to learn classification models that have higher performance as compared to learning
  a single model by aggregating all the data together or learning a separate model
  for each data source. The performance of these methods relies on label accuracy.
  We develop two models that address the problem of multitask learning when the training
  data has imprecise labels. We apply these methods to the task of detecting abnormal
  cortical regions in the MRIs of patients suffering from epilepsy whose MRI were
  deemed normal by neuroradiologists. We use the results of intracranial-EEG exam
  as an auxiliary source of supervision. The proposed methods successfully detect
  abnormal regions for all patients in our sample and achieve higher performance as
  compared to other methods.
