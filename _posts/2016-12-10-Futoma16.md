title: Identifiable Phenotyping using Constrained Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
abstract: Accurate prediction of the future trajectory of a disease is an important
  challenge in personalized medicine and population health management.  However, many
  complex chronic diseases exhibit large degrees of heterogeneity, and furthermore
  there is not always a single readily available biomarker to quantify disease severity.  Even
  when such a clinical variable exists, there are often additional related biomarkers
  that may help improve prediction of future disease state.  To this end, we propose
  a novel probabilistic generative model for multivariate longitudinal data that captures
  dependencies between multivariate trajectories of clinical variables.  We use a
  Gaussian process based regression model for each individual trajectory, and build
  off ideas from latent class models to induce dependence between their mean functions.  We
  develop a scalable variational inference algorithm that we use to fit our model
  to a large dataset of longitudinal electronic patient health records.  Our modelâ€™s
  dynamic predictions have significantly lower errors compared to a recent state of
  the art method for modeling disease trajectories, and they are being incorporated
  into a population health rounding tool to be used by clinicians at our local accountable
  care organization.
