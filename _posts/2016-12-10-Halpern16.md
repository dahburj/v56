title: Clinical Tagging with Joint Probabilistic Models
abstract: We describe a method for parameter estimation in bipartite probabilistic
  graphical models for joint prediction of clinical conditions from the electronic
  medical record. The method does not rely on the availability of gold-standard labels,
  but rather uses noisy labels, called anchors, for learning. We provide a likelihood-based
  objective and a moments-based initialization that are effective at learning the
  model parameters. The learned model is evaluated in a task of assigning a heldout
  clinical condition to patients based on retrospective analysis of the records, and
  outperforms baselines which do not account for the noisiness in the labels or do
  not model the conditions jointly.
