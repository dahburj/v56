title: Diagnostic Prediction Using Discomfort Drawings with IBTM
abstract: In this paper, we explore the possibility to apply machine learning to make
  diagnostic predictions using discomfort drawings. Discomfort drawings have proven
  to be an effective method to collect patient data and make diagnostic decisions
  in real-life practice.  A dataset from relevant patient cases is collected for which
  medical experts provide diagnostic labels.  Next, we use a factorized multimodal
  topic model, Inter-Battery Topic Model (IBTM), to train a system that can make diagnostic
  predictions given an unseen discomfort drawing. Experimental results show reasonable
  predictions of diagnostic labels given an unseen discomfort drawing.  Additionally,
  we generate synthetic discomfort drawings with IBTM given a diagnostic label, which
  results in typical cases of symptoms. The positive result indicates a significant
  potential of machine learning to be used for parts of the pain diagnostic process
  and to be a decision support system for physicians and other health care personnel.
