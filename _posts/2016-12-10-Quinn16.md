title: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Microscopy-Based Point of Care Diagnostics
abstract: 'Point of care diagnostics using microscopy and computer vision methods
  have been applied to a number of practical problems, and are particularly relevant
  to low-income, high disease burden areas. However, this is subject to the limitations
  in sensitivity and specificity of the computer vision methods used. In general,
  deep learning has recently revolutionised the field of computer vision, in some
  cases surpassing human performance for other object recognition tasks. In this paper,
  we evaluate the performance of deep convolutional neural networks on three different
  microscopy tasks: diagnosis of malaria in thick blood smears, tuberculosis in sputum
  samples, and intestinal parasite eggs in stool samples. In all cases accuracy is
  very high and substantially better than an alternative approach more representative
  of traditional medical imaging techniques.'
