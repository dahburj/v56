title: Input-Output Non-Linear Dynamical Systems applied to Physiological Condition
  Monitoring
abstract: We present a non-linear dynamical system for modelling the effect of  drug
  infusions on the vital signs of patients admitted in Intensive  Care Units (ICUs).
  More specifically we are interested in modelling  the effect of a widely used anaesthetic
  drug (Propofol) on a patientâ€™s  monitored depth of anaesthesia and haemodynamics.
  We compare our  approach with one from the Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics (PK/PD)  literature
  and show that we can provide significant improvements in  performance without requiring
  the incorporation of expert  physiological knowledge in our system.
