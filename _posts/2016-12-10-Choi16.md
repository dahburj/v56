title: 'Doctor AI: Predicting Clinical Events via Recurrent Neural Networks'
abstract: Leveraging large historical data in electronic health record (EHR), we developed
  Doctor AI, a generic predictive model that covers observed medical conditions and
  medication uses. Doctor AI is a temporal model using recurrent neural networks (RNN)
  and was developed and applied to longitudinal time stamped EHR data from 260K patients
  and 2,128 physicians over 8 years. Encounter records (e.g. diagnosis codes, medication
  codes or procedure codes) were input to RNN to predict (all) the diagnosis and medication
  categories for a subsequent visit. Doctor AI assesses the history of patients to
  make multilabel predictions (one label for each diagnosis or medication category).
  Based on separate blind test set evaluation, Doctor AI can perform differential
  diagnosis with up to 79% recall@30, significantly higher than several baselines.
  Moreover, we demonstrate great generalizability of Doctor AI by adapting the resulting
  models from one institution to another without losing substantial accuracy.
