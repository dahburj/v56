title: Identifiable Phenotyping using Constrained Non-Negative Matrix Factorization
abstract: This work proposes a new algorithm for automated and simultaneous phenotyping
  of multiple co-occurring medical conditions, also referred to as comorbidities,
  using clinical notes from electronic health records (EHRs). A latent factor estimation
  technique, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF), is augmented with domain constraints
  from weak supervision to obtain sparse latent factors that are grounded to a fixed
  set of chronic conditions. The proposed grounding mechanism ensures a one-to-one
  identifiable and interpretable mapping between the latent factors and the target
  comorbidities. Qualitative assessment of the empirical results by clinical experts
  show that the proposed model learns clinically interpretable phenotypes which are
  also shown to have competitive performance on 30 day mortality prediction task.
  The proposed method can be readily adapted to any non-negative EHR data across various
  healthcare institutions.
