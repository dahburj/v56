title: Using Kernel Methods and Model Selection for Prediction of Preterm Birth
abstract: 'We describe an application of machine learning to the problem of predicting
  preterm birth. We conduct a secondary analysis on a clinical trial dataset collected
  by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) while focusing
  our attention on predicting different classes of preterm birth. We compare three
  approaches for deriving predictive models: a support vector machine (SVM) approach
  with linear and non-linear kernels, logistic regression with different model selection
  along with a model based on decision rules prescribed by physician experts for prediction
  of preterm birth. Our approach highlights the pre-processing methods applied to
  handle the inherent dynamics, noise and gaps in the data and describe techniques
  used to handle skewed class distributions. Empirical experiments demonstrate significant
  improvement in predicting preterm birth compared to past work.'
