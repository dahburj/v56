title: 'gLOP: the global and Local Penalty for Capturing Predictive Heterogeneity'
abstract: 'When faced with a supervised learning problem, we hope to have rich enough
  data to build a model that predicts future instances well. However, in practice,
  problems can exhibit predictive heterogeneity: most instances might be relatively
  easy to predict, while others might be predictive outliers for which a model trained
  on the entire dataset does not perform well. Identifying these can help focus future
  data collection. We present gLOP, the global and Local Penalty, a framework for
  capturing predictive heterogeneity and identifying predictive outliers. gLOP is
  based on penalized regression for multitask learning, which improves learning by
  leveraging training signal information from related tasks. We give two optimization
  algorithms for gLOP, one space-efficient, and another giving the full regularization
  path. We also characterize uniqueness in terms of the data and tuning parameters,
  and present empirical results on synthetic data and on two health research problems.'
