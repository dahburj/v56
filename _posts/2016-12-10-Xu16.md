title: A Non-parametric Bayesian Approach for Estimating Treatment-Response Curves
  from Sparse Time Series
abstract: We study the problem of estimating the continuous response over time of
  actions from observational time seriesâ€”a retrospective dataset where the policy
  by which the data are generated are unknown to the learner. We develop a novel method
  based on Bayesian nonparametrics (BNP) that can flexibly model functional data and
  provide posterior inference over the treatment response curves both at the individual
  and population level. On a challenging dataset containing time series from patients
  admitted to a hospital, we estimate treatment responses for 8 different treatments
  used in managing blood pressure and kidney function and show that the resulting
  fits are more accurate than alternative approaches. Accurate methods for obtaining
  ITRs from observational data can dramatically accelerate the pace at which personalized
  treatment plans become possible.
