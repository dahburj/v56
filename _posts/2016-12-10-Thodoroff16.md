title: Learning Robust Features using Deep Learning for Automatic Seizure Detection
abstract: We present and evaluate the capacity of a deep neural network to learn robust
  features from EEG to automatically detect seizures. This is a challenging problem
  because seizure manifestations on EEG are extremely variable both inter- and intra-patient.
  By simultaneously capturing spectral, temporal and spatial information our recurrent
  convolutional neural network learns a general spatially invariant representation
  of a seizure. The proposed approach exceeds significantly previous results obtained
  on cross-patient classifiers both in terms of sensitivity and false positive rate.
  Furthermore, our model proves to be robust to missing channel and variable electrode
  montage.
